      <h1>Croissants</h1>
      <p>
        Most food historians trace the origins of the croissant to Austria and
        elsewhere in Eastern Europe, where small pastries called kipferl had
        been made since at least the 13th century, according to numerous
        records.

        While little is known about their original composition, kipferl were
        simple pastries that might be served plain or laced with nuts.

        Popular lore has it that a group of Vienna bakers invented the prototype
        for the croissant in 1863, during an Ottoman siege on the Austrian
        capital. Ottoman troops, who dug a tunnel to enter the then-walled city
        from underground, were supposedly reported to the authorities by one or
        more of the city’s bakers, who typically worked in cellars and thus
        heard the approaching attack. The Ottomans were expelled from the city,
        the story goes, and to commemorate the victory– and the heroic alert
        triggered by a baker named Adam Spiel– he and others concocted a
        crescent-shaped pastry called Hörnchen (little horns). These were
        similar to the traditional kipferl but shaped into the form of a
        crescent moon, which appeared on the flags of the Ottoman Empire from
        the 14th century. However, many have put this theory into strong doubt,
        noting for example that crescent moon-shaped breads and cakes, including
        kipferl, had been mentioned in poems and other texts for centuries prior
        to the Vienna attack.
